# Univax: How not to implement collaborative editing

All the code in here is meant as a motivating example
for a talk on [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type).

The hope is that the code will be complicated enough,
or the latency bad enough,
or the fact that we're implementing a whole text editor
self-evidently ridiculous enough,
that CRDTs will seem amazing by comparison.
